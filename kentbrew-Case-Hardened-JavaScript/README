Case-Hardened JavaScript is a framework for widgeteering, prototyping, bookmarklet-izing, and Greasemonkey-ifying little bits of this-n-that; you'll find variations all over the place, most notably in every Pipes badge on the planet and in Netflix's spiffy new movie widgets.  

I've repeatedly lost track of where I've left my current best instance of this bit of code, so I'm going to try putting it up on GitHub.
